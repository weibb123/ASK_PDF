stream run app.py

## Motivation
Would it be great if I can have a document assistant that can asnwers my questions or aid my reading about a pdf doucment?

While learning to adapt RAG(retrieval Augmented Generation) to LLM applications, I want to experiement on building a document assitant.


## Evaluation
To measure the performance of this LLM system, I compare the true answer(reference answer) with GPT's answer and attained average of 89% accuracies.

It is capable of answering questions such as: what is this document about, summary.

## Lesson Learned
GPT-4-preview-1106 provide most reasoning and quality response due to updated knowledge (2023)

GPT-4 still good

GPT-3.5.turbo-1106 is good but sometimes giving extra informations that are not relevant.

RAG has many potentials as if you can feed a longer page documents without going over context limit...
